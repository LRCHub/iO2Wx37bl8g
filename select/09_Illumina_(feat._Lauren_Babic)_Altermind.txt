Finally
This time I'll do things differently
I watched you slip away from me
As the life left from your eyes
Somehow you'll see
I'll find my way back to you
We'll carry on 'cause there's no change without suffering

Break the chains, light the way
Illuminate the darkness that remains
Regain the power to recreate
Cause nothing here is permanent
Embrace the change we face
We're wiping the slate clean
Erase decisions already made
Uncover the mystery

Replay
The moment we were led astray
Deciphering it piece by piece to
Perceive
Guided by an energy
Our new reality to...

Bend and break
Destroy and build it up again
Fate is a maze we can escape
Rewriting history to fix our mistakes
We're left in the unknowing
Running aimlessly in a never ending labyrinth
You are lost with me (Yeah)
Start again
Beginning
At the end

Can we know for certain
If death is but a dream
We're going in circles
The wheel is ever spinning
Wrapped around it's finger
Like puppets on a string
Severe the ties of fate
Light the way to your own destiny
Illuminate

Break the chains, light the way
Illuminate the darkness that remains
Regain the power to recreate
Cause nothing here is permanent
Embrace the change we face
We're wiping the slate clean
Erase decisions already made
Uncover the mystery
